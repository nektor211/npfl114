John Donovan from Argghhh! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah.
Click here To view it.
One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah.
Compare the flags to the Fallujah one.
This Fallujah operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the US Military since the end of the war.
The United States doesn't believe the Iranian Government.
One can suspect the Iranian Government.
They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti-proliferation treaty.
Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure.
One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage.
It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof.
The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders.
BREYER filed a concurring opinion, in which KENNEDY, SOUTER, and GINSBURG joined.
KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part, in which SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II.
SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion, in which THOMAS and ALITO joined.
ALITO filed a dissenting opinion, in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III.
It will take me a little while to read the whole thing, but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion.
I'll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I'm finished.
I had to go to the BBC for this report .
And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs, according to the local UN officials.
Warren Buffett is giving away 85% of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Which essentially sounds like he's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon.
Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .
This is just another reason to never trust the MSM, and certainly not the Europeans.
It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government.
It called a "ploy" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah.
Which is why he didn't say we're at war with Islamic people.
We're at war with Islamic fascists.
Saad Khalid, 19, of Eclipse Avenue, Mississauga.
Folks, if it's Islamic, and fascist, it's an Islamic fascist.
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al-Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days.
This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath.
They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany.
These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra.
So now there are hundreds of al-Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before.
The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday.
It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden's plot.
Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush.
Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming.
We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq.
Even after the attacks on September 11, Bush was obsessing about Iraq.
Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50% chance that Iraq was behind them.
The hijackers were obviously al-Qaeda, and no operational links between al-Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found).
Neither did Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Wolfowitz.
They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam's great white whale.
Bush demoted Dick Clarke, among the most vocal and focused of the al-Qaeda experts, from his cabinet.
As for the Clinton administration, let me say one thing in its defense.
I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong.
You also need Pakistani air space.
But in fall of 1999, Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif.
Musharraf told Clinton he couldn't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden.
But for those of you tempted in that direction, please look up Carter's Tabas operation.
Someone told me that Chase is planning a shitload of layoffs.

The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995.
By September of that year the Dow had tumbled to 744.
The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67.
By March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of '68.
The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70.
By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in February of '72.
A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of 1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish.
But by December of '73 the Dow had collapsed to 788.
Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577.
And that's the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down.

His artworks were selected and exhibited in British Museum in 2002.
In the world of "Wei's magic cubes," all seem to be ingeniously planned and tricky.
It looks like the war between Microsoft and Google is quickly brewing on the horizon.
Microsoft is 4-0 (they took down Netscape, Suns Systems, MAC and IBM) and Google may be their next target.
Google is probably making this move to counter Microsoft Search using Encarta (it's online dictionary).
Sure Google, although this would put it on coarse for global domination of the internet by 2014.

Wise decision to go through the private sector--NASA's budget may be kinda tight to fund a project like this.
With their proposal of a "Earth-Moon" highway, it looks like space tourism may become a reality sooner than we think.

Thank you , Mr Kinnock .
Thank you , Mr Kinnock .
I 'm afraid so , he mumbled in his Englishman 's way .
I imagine by the time she 's prepared to trust the baby to Venetia the celebrations 'll be over .
Good Lord , I 've no idea , I 'm sure he has n't either .
The man spoke with an accent , and a certain European kind of resignation .
A youthful black official at passport control said uncertainly , Just a minute .
But my mother is a Gala .
You could make it to Matoko in , say , six or seven .
Roly Dando had n't discovered the blacks as his fellows only yesterday .
I know Mweta .
It 's enough to make your hair stand on end , said Dando ; and enjoyed the effect .
I know when is eat-e chicken , I know when is eat-e beef .
I specially did n't say anything about the colour because I did n't want to muddle you up .
The Bench does n't change of course .
Ras Asahe , I came to your place in England once .
Joseph Asahe was one of Edward Shinza 's lieutenants in the early days of PIP .
But they call me James .
Well , I 've picked someone my own size at last tonight .
Get her to sing , Dando called out proudly .
Come and have a drink with James ...
My niece Vivien found a carpenter .
I showed off by making a point of speaking to the servant in Gala .
He took Swahili lessons conscientiously and he certainly spoke it better than I did .
Roland Dando said we probably should be seeing you at the Rhino .
Oh , how do you know ? said Wentz .
Mrs. Wentz had the tone of voice that sounds as if the speaker is addressing noone but himself .
She was shaking her head slowly while Odara was speaking .
Well , why do n't we all go , that 's what I want t' know .
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long , loud belch from the Dursleys son , Dudley .
And you ? said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry .
This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry .
Too right you will , said Uncle Vernon forcefully .
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest Headmaster Hogwarts has ever had .
Exhausted , stomach rumbling , mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions , Harry fell into an uneasy sleep .
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron , and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side .
He snatched up Hedwig 's cage , dashed to the window and passed it out to Ron .
But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry 's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon 's grasp .
I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts .
Draco Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind , thoughtful and sensitive boy .
Yeah , Mum 's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing , said George .
Touchdown ! said Fred as , with a slight bump , they hit the ground .
Mrs Weasley came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next .
Do n't be so ridiculous , Fred , said Mrs Weasley , her cheeks rather pink .
I do n't think I could stand the shame .
Mrs Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday .
Trying hard to bear all this in mind , Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire .
The smile faded slightly from Mr Borgin 's face .
Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date .
A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , Ron read aloud off the back cover .
