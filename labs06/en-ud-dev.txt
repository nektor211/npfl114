It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons.
The case against Iran has a feeling of Deja vu.

I ran across this item on the Internet.
The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U.S. citizens (most of whom were "dual-citizens").
Then, eschewing normal procedure, the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U.S. citizen.

Peter Stillman walked into the room and sat down in a red velvet armchair opposite Quinn .
He sat there dumbly in his seat , looking back at Stillman .
Maybe I make you the manager , said the counterman .
He had not really lost himself ; he was merely pretending , and he could return to being Quinn whenever he wished .
Moving in this manner was difficult for Quinn .
Things had happened too quickly , and he had taken it for granted that he could fill in for Paul Auster .
It could be that Auster had so much work he did n't need to advertise .
I 'm sorry to disturb you , Quinn apologized . But I 'm looking for Paul Auster .
I 'm afraid you 've got the wrong Paul Auster .
All right , said Quinn at last .
Then he leaned back on the sofa and looked Quinn in the eyes .
Still , I 've always suspected that Cervantes devoured those old romances .
But Sancho can neither read nor write .
And then to Quinn , with that same ironic smile , Daniel , this is Daniel .
He turned on the television and watched the first two innings of the Mets game .
Entering the 747 , my wife , Alexandra , and I are enfiladed by eyes that lie dark in hairy ambush .
The British Airways chicken with the chill of death upon it lies before me .
He addresses me again in Yiddish .
Alexandra is Rumanian .
His paper is not friendly to Israel .
I look downward toward the Dead Sea , over broken rocks and small houses with bulbous roofs .
Returning to it next day , I found Faulkner guilty of no offense .
This is a thought that sometimes crosses Jewish minds .
The Valley of Jehosaphat , with its tombs .
As we go up into the Via Dolorosa , we hear an exciting jingle .
I have n't the book handy , so I paraphrase .
Apparently Russians are all inclined to see us in this way .
Even on a sunny morning the stone buildings of Jerusalem chill your hands and feet .
Stepping out , I feel a bit numb , like a wasp in autumn .
John and his dog , Mississippi , went there every day .
In little pangs , said John .
The Nellie , a cruising yawl , swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails , and was at rest .
The Chapman lighthouse , a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat , shone strongly .
It was just like Marlow . It was accepted in silence .
The North Pole was one of these places , I remember .
But there was one yet - the biggest , the most blank , so to speak - that I had a hankering after .
I believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets .
The mere wealth I leave to others .
After this I got embraced , told to wear flannel , be sure to write often , and so on - and I left .
I said , Yes .
He had just the faintest blush , and said modestly , I 've been teaching one of the native women about the station .

The noise outside had ceased , and presently in going out I stopped at the door .
As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the carriers .
An hour afterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush - man , hammock , groans , blankets , horrors .
I felt I was becoming scientifically interesting .
As a matter of fact , I had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river .
That , and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station , took some months .
There were rumors that a very important station was in jeopardy , and its chief , Mr. Kurtz , was ill .
As to me , I had hardly ever spoken to him before .
It seems he could not make bricks without something , I do n't know what - straw maybe .
Madam President , there has clearly been a misunderstanding .
As a final point I emphasize that the existing positive actions must be kept in place .
I give the floor to Mrs Green .
Mr President , the European consumer needs to have increased confidence in food , not least after the BSE crisis .
Mr Escola Hernando is speaking for the first time in this House .
Mr President , I should merely like to answer Mr Kellett-Bowman in one sentence .
This is legislation requiring a unanimous vote in the Council , which is usually a guarantee of inaction .
It is heartening that the European Union recognises the problems and is willing to focus on them .
Mr President , many thanks to Mr Barzanti .
Too many continue to scrape together a living in a kind of La Boheme garret .
However , I can not support the reference to abortion .
I would very much like to know on what kind of scientific evidence the Greens are basing all these amendments .
Then there is Amendment No-12 .
Then there is the famous project No-8 of the 14 very important projects endorsed by the Essen summit .
He said to his wife , Mweta 's invited me to come back as their guest .
Never mind , Mrs. Bray will join you later .
He made a resigned grimace assuming understanding ... My wife and I decided we could n't stick it any longer .
I 'm looking after Colonel Bray , no need to bother him .
I do it to Umsalongwe in ten hours .
Give time for Mweta to shine on his own for a bit , and any tension between them to die down .
When I said yes to Mweta I knew it and every time I walk past the title on my office door I know it .
Poor old Dando .
That I can count on .

Margot Wentz said , looking at no one , That one ca n't say .
The Dursleys had n't even remembered that today happened to be Harry 's twelfth birthday .
Excellent , Dudley , said Uncle Vernon .
He did n't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did in Privet Drive .
Dobby leaned towards Harry , his eyes wide as headlamps .
He jumped the last six stairs , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby .
On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby .
